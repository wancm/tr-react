/**
 * React rely on a pure function for performance and do it's rendering works efficiently
 *
 * A pure function is a function that always return the same results if same parameters are passed in.
 *  - Easy to test
 *  - Predictable
 *  - Reliable
 *  - Cache-able
 *
 *  Function of a component must be pure
 *   - The function should always return the same jsx if give the same state

/** Therefore, we could use the React memorized version

 * usually its only faster:-
 *  - Pure functional component
 *  - Renders often
 *  - with the same prop values
 *  - JSX isn't trivial
 *      Take this HouseRow component as example:
